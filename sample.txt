Having the faith to follow the Savior begins with small steps, often less dramatic than those required of Peter, Andrew, James, and John. It is a daily desire to be more like him. As President Thomas S. Monson reminds us, “There is no resting place along the path called faithfulness. The trek is constant, and no lingering is allowed” (Ensign, October 1993, page 4).
